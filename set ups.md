I

1. Clone the repository ( or fork it )
    https://github.com/omegalabsinc/omega-awesome-a2a  

2. Download and setup Phi-2 locally:
    # Create virtual environment
python -m venv phi2-env
source phi2-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: phi2-env\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install torch transformers accelerate
pip install safetensors

# Download Phi-2 model
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "microsoft/phi-2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)


3. Install required package:
    bash        
        pip install gradio

4. Run the UI:
    bash
        python phi2_explorer_ui.py

1. Verify Backend Setup
Ensure the backend API or service is configured to support Phi-2 inference. The useModelInference hook should point to the appropriate endpoint or service.

Example: The runInference function in the hook should send requests to the backend that hosts the Phi-2 model.
2. Launch AI Explorer
Start the development server for the AI Explorer frontend.

npm start
This will open the interface in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

3. Test Phi-2 Model Interaction
Navigate to the Phi-2 Model Interface in the AI Explorer UI.
Enter a sample input into the text field (e.g., "Explain the impact of quantum computing on cryptography.").
Click the Analyze button.
Observe the loading indicator while the request is being processed.
Wait for the generated response to appear in the results container.
4. Debugging Tips
Inspect Network Calls: Open the browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) and monitor the network tab to ensure the inference request is successful.
Look for the request to the backend endpoint (e.g., /inference/phi-2).
Verify the response contains the expected output.
Check Console Logs: Any errors in the frontend (e.g., inference failure) will appear in the console logs. Backend logs will help diagnose server-side issues.
5. Example Test Input and Expected Output
